#  TCP KILLER
how to use?

```
# Install Script
# Make sure you have downloaded Python
git clone https://github.com/AdrianIchiro/tcp-killer
```

```
# Welcome the page
[+] ip: # fill in the target IP (can be a domain)
[+] port: # fill port
[+] packet: # fill packet
[+] thread: # fill thread
```
and there has been an attack :)

Don't expect the target to immediately go down because a DDOS attack requires a lot of computers to carry out the attack

Thank you for using this script

keep hacking :b
